### Simulation of Transverse Wave Propagation in an Elastic String  

📌 **Academic project** developed for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course, focused on simulating the propagation of a transverse wave along a stretched elastic string.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  

Develop a **Java application** to simulate the propagation of a **transverse wave** in a 1-meter-long elastic string.  

- The software calculates the vertical position **y(x,t)** of equally spaced points (every 1 cm) along the string.  
- The sine function is approximated using the **Taylor Polynomial Series**, ensuring the error stays below a maximum value defined by the user.  
- The simulation represents the wave evolution **over time**.
